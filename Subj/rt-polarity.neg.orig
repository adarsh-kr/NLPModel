peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
the film is probably worth seeing for the sheer spectacle of it all , for the sake of obtaining valuable information , and for finding more closure on a story that has always been missing several pieces .

yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it .

from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .

one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
sincere energy gives this soul-searcher something magic to find - if even along the beaten path . 
this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 
' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
it is von sydow who gives intacto its gravity , resonance , soul . 
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood .

a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .

the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming .

a sweet , engaging family story about the nature of faith and the power of youthful innocence . 
a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen .

this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one .

a belgian gem on the twilight existence of four sisters of a certain age drawn together reluctantly by the need to care for one of their number .

flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
 " nicholas nickleby " is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new " a christmas carol " out in the theaters this year . charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . 
as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way . 
 . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not . 
a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
food for love endeavors and largely succeeds in lending equal weight to the emotional turmoil of its older and younger characters . 
amazing ? not quite . but this film sure is lovely . 
the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
there's no denying how nice it is to see veteran actors bob hoskins , michael caine and helen mirren interacting with each other on screen . 
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
while the subject's appeal is limited and the film's 106-minute running time excessive , viewers who do respond to the pic will find it raw , real and cathartic . 
while soderbergh succeeds in recapturing the themes and mood of tarkovsky's version , he also brings with them a cold , emotionless sheen , a detached air that defeats his efforts to truly engage us . 
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households . 
the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . 
reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
a canny franchise escapade ; it gets the job done . 
its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive . 
truth is stranger than fiction , so the old saying goes . in 'catch me if you can , ' it's also more entertaining . 
as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
swimming isn't a major film . nor does it try to be . but what , in the end , is a major film ? if it's one that accomplishes what it sets out to do , then we ought to correct ourselves . 
it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke .

this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
the cast fits very convincingly into the nightmarish landscape of a ravaged country . 
the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul .

steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 
both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles ï¿½ several of them . 
even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . 
it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion . 
the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst .

there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat .

brings a rare , clinically specific sense of moral complexity and humanistic sympathy to the usual regimen of finger-pointing and exposure . 
nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances .

an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick . 
about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery

sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .

craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
the first half is a hilariously on-target send-up of " barbarella " -style flicks and the larger-than-life egos that propelled them , the second half is a ponderously self-absorbed meditation on the angst of a budding artiste .

another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .

the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .

comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
this is almodovar's stab at serious drama , and the result is bizarre and affecting but also unsettling in ways that the filmmaker may not have intended . 
halloween : resurrection is surprisingly effective , especially the opening sequence featuring the showdown between laurie and michael . 
holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . 
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 
tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard .

there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments . 
it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
the longer one watches this determinedly ragged portrait of blue-collar teenage desperation . . . the more one gets absorbed in the utter unbridled nihilism of its 'characters . '
the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story . 
on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion .

nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
hoffman spends a good deal of screen time alone and without much dialogue , using only his considerable physical skill and screen presence to pull off the role . 
for every inspired bit of absurdity , there's a lame piece of improvisational noodling . 
attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .

there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
the acting alone is worth the price of admission . 
whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game . 
10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away .

the film's apocalyptic urban setting and unrelentingly icy zeitgeist is message enough without a triumphant parting shot
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible .

the film presents a brief but intriguing biography of its subject . 
'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia fï¿½lmica imposible de olvidar'
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style .

the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . 
this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
the movie itself is timeless and universal , at once artless and sophisticated in its ability to engross . 
waydowntown just like most large cities , isn't somewhere you'll want to spend the rest of your life , but it sure is a fun place to visit for a while . 
the story really has no place to go since simone is not realï¿½she can't provide any conflict . 
on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
ice cube , as usual , is an appealing presence , but the rest of the cast shines as well . 
australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place .

a little weak -- and it isn't that funny .

the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera . 
feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .

the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean .

not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
treats a potentially explosive set-up with adult reflection and thoughtfulness . 
done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
it is fascinating to see how much work and preparation goes into stand-up comedy . 
more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .

the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichï¿½s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
for those with the stomach and stamina for its heartbeat-quickening intensity and body-slamming action , rollerball delivers exactly what it promises : a people's hero you can really get behind . 
it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances . 
a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years .

 . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
mike leigh mainstay timothy spall deftly shades in the designated goner , fellow still crazy alum bill nighy is sweetly wispy as the capable fop , and anger-management counselor olivia williams trembles pleasantly as usual . 
a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
the splendid ensemble cast inhabits these unglamorous roles with quiet gusto . 
the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
 . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
reminiscent of david mamet's elaborate screen bluffs -- only livelier , more playful .

it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
ki-duk kim has created a provocatively violent and sexual film with an oddly idyllic sensibility . it's a mysterious but ultimately rewarding experience . 
at its heart and most importantly , spirited away concerns a little girl learning to honour her friends and her family by valuing herself . 
 . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
[raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see . 
williams has now proven that he can play creepy with the best of them . 
there are wonderful moments of humor , and demonstrations of humanity , strength , and the resilience of the human spirit . 
 . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
[nï¿½s] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
french director helene angel's dark but deftly handled fable about familial violence has a terrifying , fairy-tale atmosphere that's in perfect keeping with its unique point of view . 
though talk in the film often turns to death , khatra's enthusiasm and love of life keep the movie surprisingly upbeat . 
to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
kids surely will like it . and for adults , it's perfectly watchable in a rugrats-y sort of way . 
the film is complex , intricate , interesting and almost hypnotizing , till charlie gets stuck ( the screenplay he's writing is the one you're watching ) . glad he had the gonads to do what he did then , but it subtracts from the overall entertainment value . 
cho , a clarion voice of reason in an unreasonable world , has a rare comic brilliance , incisiveness and relatability . 
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 
billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding . 
this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both . 
a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved . 
depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles . 
the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
we become complicit in our own seduction : we willingly let bielinsky manipulate us . 
'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias romï¿½nticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
the result reverberates on the screen with a deadly force and fury more intense than anything mr . scorsese has yet achieved on the meanest and most beloved streets he could imagine or recall . 
as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
it doesn't seem like it's following a fixed path to the finish . unlike so many movies , it feels alive . 
this is a rare twisted crowd-pleaser for longtime fans as well as novices -- or for those that don't know an arachnid from an insect . 
if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
not for all tastes . but i , for one , was hooked by this fish's tale . 
there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries . 
the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 
to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
jonah is sunday school lite . but it's told with a comic edge usually associated with the devilish act of laughter . 
definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
where as many films of this nature linger on the hard , the ugly , the blood , or just the stylistic ; empire focuses on the thinking , the love , and even the light-heartedness , as well as the violence . 
to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
 . . . has a bit more going for it than just bikini babes and bitchin' waves . but the plot is ankle deep at best . 
windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . 
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
by embracing the original series' tacky elements and inserting just enough self-mockery to avoid smugness , the movie manages to fulfill basic expectations . 
the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
it's the kind of film where the villain even gives an evil look for his passport photo . how can you resist that ? 
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . 
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
[a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
 " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 
the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
a very bizarre blend of reservoir dogs , fight club , unbreakable and croupier . 
the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
if there was a flu shot for the blues , it might come in the form of this embraceable ode to loneliness and love regained . 
the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
it's the extra layer that makes this one , the movie's understanding of how disillusion and inner compromise can gradually separate a young artist from his divine spark . 
reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
payami is to be applauded for taking biting potshots at such volatile issues as iran's outmoded electoral process and women's status as second-class citizens . 
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . 
a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
it's like a rap rashomon . there's a million different stories here . 
broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
bisset still commands the screen as the graceful and outspoken frances . 
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride . 
it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail . 
most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 
resident evil may be brain dead but it's great popcorn entertainment nonetheless . 
frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
 . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . 
a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . 
about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
directed by david twohy with the same great eye for eerie understatement that he brought to pitch black . 
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
mr . jacobi's recitation is illustrated with a rush of sensuous nature imagery , beautifully photographed by mr . cox and hans sonneveld and underscored with a lush soundtrack by paul grabowsky . 
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
it takes us finally to the comedy clubs that for so many years we saw only at the beginning and end of seinfeld . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
the real reason to see runteldat is to watch lawrence deploy his deep and wide powers of empathy to depict such diverse experiences as childbirth , breast-feeding and recovering from illness . 
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
when so many hollywood films actively discourage higher brain functions , you have to give changing lanes credit for giving you food for thought . 
it's a fun movie with lots of colorful characters , lots of bizarre plot meanderings and quite a few memorable lines and sequences . 
there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
 " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
o ï¿½timo esforï¿½o do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos sï¿½o explicados . 
[reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
macbeth . mcdonald's . how far apart these poles of popular culture seemed until billy morrissette's sly mcshakespeare crime comedy . 
a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
that dogged good will of the parents and 'vain' jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .

run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .

a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
national lampoon's van wilder was better than we expected ; a 'not a total waste of money' kind of dateflick for those just hitting pre-collegiate years . 
ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . 
a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
nothing short of a respectful testament to the ingenious creative drive of the outsider . 
the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie .

a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .

it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
this movie has a strong message about never giving up on a loved one , but it's not an easy movie to watch and will probably disturb many who see it . 
children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers . 
i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
 . . . a vast adventure that bristles with romance , action and heroism . 
if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
carefully crafted , notably in its deft dramatic structuring , and has become timely in a way its maker could never have anticipated . 
the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
this is one of jaglom's most accessible and genuinely enjoyable films . 
if . . . you're the adventurous sort , check it out . 
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .

' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '
the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .

the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .

just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary .

the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed .

this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
a movie that amply delivers on the epic promise of its title , entertaining , enlightening , and emboldening viewers with its deceptively simple premise and execution . 
it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making .

a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons !

hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film .

the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
taken seriously , it's not much to think about , but taken as a dirtier version of other girlie films . . . it's at least entertaining and sexy fun .

insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe .

during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
[reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability .

the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .

the talents of the actors helps " moonlight mile " rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing . 
gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up .

triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed .

an intricate tale of guilt , grief and dark serendipity . . . so deft it's hard not to gasp with delight as the plot's pieces slide into place and its machinery begins humming . 
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .

the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema . 
it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
beautifully acted , smart and funny . it steers clear of being a maudlin soap opera normally found on lifetime . 
it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ? 
a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
it's exactly what you'd expect : no more and no less . 
the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
manages to be diverting while never falling into a morass of battlefield clichï¿½s . 
presents a most persuasive vision of hell on earth . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years . 
a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
when a movie is as down-and-out funny as austin powers in goldmember , it's easy to overlook the missed opportunities and fizzled jokes littering the barrage of hilarity . 
possesses something rare : a degree of genuine reverence in its depiction of surfing as a sport and a subculture . 
diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful .
