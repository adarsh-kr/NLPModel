playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
the film is probably worth seeing for the sheer spectacle of it all , for the sake of obtaining valuable information , and for finding more closure on a story that has always been missing several pieces . 
the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes .

the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .

look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it .

gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic .

a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .

flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
 " nicholas nickleby " is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new " a christmas carol " out in the theaters this year . charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . 
as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way . 
 . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not . 
a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that .

proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
food for love endeavors and largely succeeds in lending equal weight to the emotional turmoil of its older and younger characters . 
amazing ? not quite . but this film sure is lovely . 
the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
there's no denying how nice it is to see veteran actors bob hoskins , michael caine and helen mirren interacting with each other on screen . 
when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
while the subject's appeal is limited and the film's 106-minute running time excessive , viewers who do respond to the pic will find it raw , real and cathartic .

the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 . 
an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . 
reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .

the cast fits very convincingly into the nightmarish landscape of a ravaged country . 
the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band .

it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth .

even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . 
it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion .

another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .

holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . 
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .

not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
the acting alone is worth the price of admission .

the film's apocalyptic urban setting and unrelentingly icy zeitgeist is message enough without a triumphant parting shot
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .

the film presents a brief but intriguing biography of its subject . 
'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia f�lmica imposible de olvidar'
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style .

[i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
the movie itself is timeless and universal , at once artless and sophisticated in its ability to engross . 
waydowntown just like most large cities , isn't somewhere you'll want to spend the rest of your life , but it sure is a fun place to visit for a while . 
the story really has no place to go since simone is not real�she can't provide any conflict . 
on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
ice cube , as usual , is an appealing presence , but the rest of the cast shines as well . 
australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place .

a little weak -- and it isn't that funny .

the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera . 
feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .

not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
treats a potentially explosive set-up with adult reflection and thoughtfulness . 
done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
it is fascinating to see how much work and preparation goes into stand-up comedy . 
more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna doesn't suck as an actress . 
this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
for the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie .

exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . 
the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clich�s and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle .

it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change .

a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last .

 . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking .

a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
the splendid ensemble cast inhabits these unglamorous roles with quiet gusto . 
the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others .

reminiscent of david mamet's elaborate screen bluffs -- only livelier , more playful .

all three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly balk , who's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .

ki-duk kim has created a provocatively violent and sexual film with an oddly idyllic sensibility . it's a mysterious but ultimately rewarding experience . 
at its heart and most importantly , spirited away concerns a little girl learning to honour her friends and her family by valuing herself . 
 . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .

williams has now proven that he can play creepy with the best of them . 
there are wonderful moments of humor , and demonstrations of humanity , strength , and the resilience of the human spirit . 
 . . . think of it as american pie on valium . 
the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
[n�s] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
french director helene angel's dark but deftly handled fable about familial violence has a terrifying , fairy-tale atmosphere that's in perfect keeping with its unique point of view . 
though talk in the film often turns to death , khatra's enthusiasm and love of life keep the movie surprisingly upbeat . 
to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
kids surely will like it . and for adults , it's perfectly watchable in a rugrats-y sort of way . 
the film is complex , intricate , interesting and almost hypnotizing , till charlie gets stuck ( the screenplay he's writing is the one you're watching ) . glad he had the gonads to do what he did then , but it subtracts from the overall entertainment value . 
cho , a clarion voice of reason in an unreasonable world , has a rare comic brilliance , incisiveness and relatability . 
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
davis' candid , archly funny and deeply authentic take on intimate relationships comes to fruition in her sophomore effort . 
billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding . 
this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both . 
a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved . 
depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles . 
the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
we become complicit in our own seduction : we willingly let bielinsky manipulate us . 
'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias rom�nticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
the result reverberates on the screen with a deadly force and fury more intense than anything mr . scorsese has yet achieved on the meanest and most beloved streets he could imagine or recall . 
as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
it doesn't seem like it's following a fixed path to the finish . unlike so many movies , it feels alive . 
this is a rare twisted crowd-pleaser for longtime fans as well as novices -- or for those that don't know an arachnid from an insect . 
if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
not for all tastes . but i , for one , was hooked by this fish's tale . 
there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . 
the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries . 
the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 
to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
jonah is sunday school lite . but it's told with a comic edge usually associated with the devilish act of laughter . 
definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
where as many films of this nature linger on the hard , the ugly , the blood , or just the stylistic ; empire focuses on the thinking , the love , and even the light-heartedness , as well as the violence . 
to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
 . . . has a bit more going for it than just bikini babes and bitchin' waves . but the plot is ankle deep at best . 
windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . 
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
by embracing the original series' tacky elements and inserting just enough self-mockery to avoid smugness , the movie manages to fulfill basic expectations . 
the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
it's the kind of film where the villain even gives an evil look for his passport photo . how can you resist that ? 
certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . 
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
[a]n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
 " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 
the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
a very bizarre blend of reservoir dogs , fight club , unbreakable and croupier . 
the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 
i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
if there was a flu shot for the blues , it might come in the form of this embraceable ode to loneliness and love regained . 
the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
it's the extra layer that makes this one , the movie's understanding of how disillusion and inner compromise can gradually separate a young artist from his divine spark . 
reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
payami is to be applauded for taking biting potshots at such volatile issues as iran's outmoded electoral process and women's status as second-class citizens . 
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . 
a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
it's like a rap rashomon . there's a million different stories here . 
broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
bisset still commands the screen as the graceful and outspoken frances . 
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride . 
it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail . 
most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 
resident evil may be brain dead but it's great popcorn entertainment nonetheless . 
frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
 . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . 
a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . 
about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
directed by david twohy with the same great eye for eerie understatement that he brought to pitch black . 
de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
 . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
mr . jacobi's recitation is illustrated with a rush of sensuous nature imagery , beautifully photographed by mr . cox and hans sonneveld and underscored with a lush soundtrack by paul grabowsky . 
the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
it takes us finally to the comedy clubs that for so many years we saw only at the beginning and end of seinfeld . 
follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
the real reason to see runteldat is to watch lawrence deploy his deep and wide powers of empathy to depict such diverse experiences as childbirth , breast-feeding and recovering from illness . 
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
when so many hollywood films actively discourage higher brain functions , you have to give changing lanes credit for giving you food for thought . 
it's a fun movie with lots of colorful characters , lots of bizarre plot meanderings and quite a few memorable lines and sequences . 
there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
 " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
o �timo esfor�o do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos s�o explicados . 
[reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion .

this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
macbeth . mcdonald's . how far apart these poles of popular culture seemed until billy morrissette's sly mcshakespeare crime comedy . 
a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
that dogged good will of the parents and 'vain' jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth can't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . 
in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible . 
'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop .

run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .

national lampoon's van wilder was better than we expected ; a 'not a total waste of money' kind of dateflick for those just hitting pre-collegiate years . 
ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
may not have generated many sparks , but with his affection for astoria and its people he has given his tale a warm glow . 
a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
nothing short of a respectful testament to the ingenious creative drive of the outsider .

a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .

this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why .

for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie .

a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy .

children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers . 
i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
 . . . a vast adventure that bristles with romance , action and heroism . 
if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
carefully crafted , notably in its deft dramatic structuring , and has become timely in a way its maker could never have anticipated . 
the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
this is one of jaglom's most accessible and genuinely enjoyable films . 
if . . . you're the adventurous sort , check it out . 
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .

' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '
the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .

an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .

just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary .

the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
the film is small in scope , yet perfectly formed .

this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
a movie that amply delivers on the epic promise of its title , entertaining , enlightening , and emboldening viewers with its deceptively simple premise and execution . 
it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
the story is timeless , but when adapted to the modern age , it makes for a wrenching film -- never preachy or sentimental , and refreshingly non-judgmental about the fundamental and contradictory issues it raises .

one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . 
a movie that's full of deft , off-center observations about the world of filmmaking . 
though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
produced by 20th century fox , ice age falls short of classic status . but it's one of the best such features not to wear the disney or dreamworks banner . 
on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . 
suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
should be seen and absorbed , if only to recall that hollywood horror does , occasionally , get it more or less right . 
the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
taken seriously , it's not much to think about , but taken as a dirtier version of other girlie films . . . it's at least entertaining and sexy fun . 
a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family . 
there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
as a technical exercise that redefines moviemaking , it is astonishing . 
goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
a diverting detour into the gonzo outlook of a humorist who actually has something on his mind . 
like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
the exposition does pay off , if you can stay awake that long . there's little gripping in the film until the second hour . 
andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
in the spirit of voltaire and moli�re , on guard volleys great wit and deadly gestures in a milieu of lush apparel , landscapes , captivating music and 18th-century lacy sleeves . 
insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe . 
the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense . 
a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
if much of me without you strikes a familiar chord , it also intelligently captures the difficulties that can disrupt even a close friendship . 
the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 
beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
a near perfect fusion of computer and cel animation . 
a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
[reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 
the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done . 
in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
the talents of the actors helps " moonlight mile " rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing . 
gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
think 'glengarry glen ross' without the mamet dialogue , and that's kinda what you'll get here . 
the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
it's halloween season , and while ghost ship can't hold a candle to the ring for true primal scares , it'll probably stay respectably afloat until at least most of the candy is gone . 
i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales . 
the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
 . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed . 
perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
serry perfectly captures the peculiar climate , creating uncanny echoes with today's situation . 
harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . 
chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
the whole of sunshine state is less than the sum of its parts , but the parts are often lovely , and always true . 
jolie gives it that extra little something that makes it worth checking out at theaters , especially if you're in the mood for something more comfortable than challenging . 
tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
that we are not the target and still got ninety percent of it is a compliment to director charles stone iii and screenwriters matthew cirulnick and thulani davis who whipped the original story into coherent shape . 
blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .

plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .

the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .

splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed . 
interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 
a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm .

too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .

the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .

grief is awkward and funny and strange sometimes . so is moonlight mile .

in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
an intricate tale of guilt , grief and dark serendipity . . . so deft it's hard not to gasp with delight as the plot's pieces slide into place and its machinery begins humming . 
an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .

[janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . 
this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema . 
it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
beautifully acted , smart and funny . it steers clear of being a maudlin soap opera normally found on lifetime . 
it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ? 
a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
it's exactly what you'd expect : no more and no less . 
the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
[green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
manages to be diverting while never falling into a morass of battlefield clich�s . 
presents a most persuasive vision of hell on earth . 
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years . 
a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
when a movie is as down-and-out funny as austin powers in goldmember , it's easy to overlook the missed opportunities and fizzled jokes littering the barrage of hilarity . 
possesses something rare : a degree of genuine reverence in its depiction of surfing as a sport and a subculture . 
diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful .
